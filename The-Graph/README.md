# The Graph

## What is The Graph?

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It allows developers to build serverless applications that run entirely on the blockchain. By providing the infrastructure to efficiently gather and process blockchain data, The Graph enables the creation of dynamic, decentralized applications (dApps) with rich features similar to those of traditional web applications.

Some services The Graph provides include:

- Decentralized Data Indexing,
- GraphQL API for Data Queries,
- Subgraph Development Tools,
- Network Participation for Indexers, Curators, and Delegators,
- Tutorials and Documentation for Developers.
