# Chainlink

## What is Chainlink?

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts on Ethereum to securely connect to external data sources, APIs, and payment systems. It stands as a critical piece of infrastructure in the blockchain ecosystem, facilitating the creation of fully functional, real-world connected dApps by providing reliable, tamper-proof data and off-chain computation.

Some services Chainlink provides include:

- Decentralized Data Oracles,
- Verifiable Random Function (VRF),
- Chainlink Automation,
- External Adapters,
- Data Feeds,
- Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol,
- Keepers,
- Tutorials and Integration Guides.
